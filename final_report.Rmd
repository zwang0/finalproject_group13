## Introduction
Bike-Sharing systems are currently widely introduced in urban cities to solve the 
“last mile” problem, improve the link between other modes of transportation. 
Bike-sharing systems facilitate the use of public transportation, enhance traffic 
troubles, as well as minimize greenhouse gas emissions. However, the availability 
and accessibility of sharing bikes could be a problem since the demand and supply 
of bikes are not stable.

This project aims to use machine learning and data-mining-based  algorithms to 
predict the demand for rental bikes in Seoul city at each hour in order to provide 
a stable bike supply. The project is based on the dataset downloaded at UC Irvine 
Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains the hourly public rental number 
of Seoul bikes with date and weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Wind speed, 
Visibility, Dew point, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall) for one year from December 
2017 to November 2018, 365 days. The number of rental bikes rented at every hour 
is determined from the bike rental history data collected from the Seoul Public 
Data Park website of South Korea.[1]

As all modes of transportation depend primarily on the weather conditions, including 
cycling, we would assume that the corresponding climate conditions have effects 
on the total number of rental bikes rented at each hour. And we would also assume 
that date parameters such as weekdays may enhance the performance of the prediction 
model. Thus, weather details and date parameters would be the covariates of the 
model.
